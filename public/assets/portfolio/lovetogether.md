# Overview
[Love Together](https://www.love-together.com/) is a relationship support company.
I worked for the company as a full stack intern, working primarily on the frontend, from February of 2023 to July of 2023.
The company's website is a SAAS product that provides users with tools for improving their relationships with quizzes and profile comparison maps.
When I was working at the company, they were not as far along as they are now, and we had only just finished implementing authorization for users. Many of the features of the site 
that are present today were not while I was interning there. 


# Tech Stack
Love Together is a MERN app, meaning the server is written in `Typescript`, the Frontend is written in React, and the database is a `MongoDB` instance. 

# My Role
As one of 4 interns, I took on a multitude of tasks as they were divied up between us weekly. My primary contributions to the website were: 
* implementing the wireframes made by the company's designer in figma in code
* building the integration with square to allow for subscription plans
