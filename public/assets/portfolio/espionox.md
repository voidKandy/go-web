# Simplifying Writing LLM Applications in Rust

I began working on Espionox in August of 2023, it's an attempt to make
building Ai applications in Rust just as approachable as it is with other
libraries such as LangChain.

# Features 
## Function Calling Syntax specific to Espionox
Instead of using raw JSON to define functions, they can be defined in a specific syntax I invented. I wrote a transpiler which converts functions written in this
syntax into a valid JSON request. For example: 

```
get_n_day_weather_forecast(location: string, format!: enum('celcius' | 'farenheight'), num_days!: integer)
    where 
        i am 'get an n-day weather forecast'
        location is 'the city and state, e.g. san francisco, ca'
        format is 'the temperature unit to use. infer this from the users location.'
        num_days is 'the number of days to forcast'
```

transpiles into:

```json
{
 "name": "get_n_day_weather_forecast",
      "description": "Get an N-day weather forecast",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "the city and state, e.g. san francisco, ca"
          },
            "num_days": {
            "type": "integer",
            "description": "the number of days to forcast",
            },
          "format": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["celcius", "fahrenheight"]
          }
        },
        "required": ["num_days", "format"]
    }
}
```

## Easily inject Callbacks into prompting flows
Espionox's callback system, called `Listeners` in the crate, make creating things like RAG pipelines and Self Consistency mechanisms a lot easier to build.
