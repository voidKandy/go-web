        I spent 5 years as a full time musician, but in 2022 I discovered a
        passion for software:

      <ul class="mb-4 mt-2">
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <li>I was an intern at a small startup,
          <a href="https://www.love-together.com/">Love-Together</a> 
        </li>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <li>I'm the core writer and maintainer of my own LangChain inspired Rust
            library, <a href="https://github.com/voidKandy/espionox_lib">Espionox</a>
        </li>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <li>I've built / maintained multiple websites using Svelte/React/Htmx</li>
        <li>I've trained / fine-tuned my own machine learning models</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since delving into software, I've been
        <a href="https://voidkandy.substack.com/">keeping a blog</a>
        of my progress. Despite not being enrolled in any institution, I
        approach my learning as a full-time student. I'm driven completely by a
        deep desire to improve myself and my skills in anything I find
        interesting. I'm most drawn to developing tool driven by AI agents,
        though I've also been known to dabble in web development.<br />
