        From Music to Code
      </h1>
      <br />
      <p class="px-6">
        What began as a love for guitar and music composition became a passion
        for production and sound design. Ableton was an excellent gateway drug
        into software. Looking back, it's hard to tell if I was more interested
        in the music or just pushing the DAW as far as I could. After completing
        a multimedia music project and spending months grinding self promotion
        on social media, I was dissatisfied. Years of releases, combined with an
        admittedly half baked marketing strategy, had not resulted in the music
        career I naively thought it would, something had to change.

        Self Taught Developer

        I had always been interested by programming, but I believed it was 'too
        complicated' for the likes of a grug brain like myself. The
        accessibility that ChatGPT brought to programming was the push I needed
        to really dive into it. I began writing stupid little Python scripts
        with the help of GPT-3.5, and eventually found myself fascinated with
        machine learning models, which led me to moving to a part time position
        at my day job to study machine learning on my own.
        <br />
        <br />
        A few months later I was grinding through the Fast.ai program led by
        Jeremy Howard. I had few classification and fine-tuned models under my
        belt and I wanted to go for something a little more ambitious. So, I
        became an unofficial member of my friend's senior capstone project
        group. We were to build a speech separation model using a RAG
        architecture. We failed, but learned a lot, and I had to admit to myself
        that I had significant gap in my knowledge of computer science that was
        holding me back.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since then, I've taken multiple online computer science courses and
        decided to learn Rust in the hopes that it's complexity would make other
        languages relatively easier to learn, an assumption which has paid off
        for the most part. I'm now significantly less inept at programming.
