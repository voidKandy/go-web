        I spent 5 years as a full time musician, but since 2022 I've been
        completely engrossed in software:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 mt-2">
        <li>I was an intern at a small startup called LoveTogether</li>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <li>I'm the core writer and maintainer of my own LangChain-like Rust
          library; Espionox
        </li>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <li>I've built/maintained multiple websites using Svelte/React/Htmx</li>
        <li>I've trained / fine-tuned my own machine learning models</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Though I am not enrolled in any institution, I consider myself a full
        time student. Since March of 2022 I've been studying software
        architecture design, applied AI, and web design. I have a lot to learn
        in the realm of software but I believe I'm ready to join a team of
        developers, and as someone with nearly a decade of experience in the
        service industry, I may possess more soft skills than other developers
        fresh out of University.
