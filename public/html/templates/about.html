        Spent 5 years as a full time musician before realizing that software and
        machine learning was better suited for his psychologic makeup.

        What started as a love for guitar and music composition became a passion
        for production and sound design. Ableton was an excellent gateway drug
        into software. It was hard to tell if he was more interested in the
        music or in pushing the DAW as far as he could. After completing a
        multimedia music project and spending months grinding self promotion on
        social media, he was dissatisfied. Years of releases had not resulted in
        the music career he naively thought it would, something had to change.
        The release of ChatGPT led to the discovery of Python, because of the
        chatbot, programming became much more accessible. Pair programming
        stupid little .py scripts with GPT-3.5 eventually led to a fascination
        with machine learning. That fascination led to a genuine attempt to
        create his own models until the unfortunate reality of his lack of
        software knowledge got in the way. Since then he’s been obsessed with
        expanding his knowledge of software. Multiple personal projects and a
        newfound love of the Rust programming language leaves a job where he’s
        surrounded by much more talented developers as the only acceptable
        future on the horizon.
